Method	Return Type	Description
animationStart()	none	Start playing the animation. Only applicable when animation data is available.
animationStop()	none	Stop playing the animation. Only applicable when animation data is available.
getCameraPosition()	An object with parameters horizontal, vertical and distance	Returns an object with parameters horizontal, vertical and distance, which each one of them is a number, representing the rotation and position of the camera.
redraw()	none	Redraw the graph. Useful after the camera position is changed externally, when data is changed, or when the layout of the webpage changed.
setData(data)	none	Replace the data in the Graph3d.
setOptions(options)	none	Update options of Graph3d. The provided options will be merged with current options.
setSize(width, height)	none	Parameters width and height are strings, containing a new size for the graph. Size can be provided in pixels or in percentages.
setCameraPosition (pos)	{horizontal: 1.0, vertical: 0.5, distance: 1.7}	Set the rotation and position of the camera. Parameter pos is an object which contains three parameters: horizontal, vertical, and distance. Parameter horizontal is a value in radians and can have any value (but normally in the range of 0 and 2*Pi). Parameter vertical is a value in radians between 0 and 0.5*Pi. Parameter distance is the (normalized) distance from the camera to the center of the graph, in the range of 0.71 to 5.0. A larger distance puts the graph further away, making it smaller. All parameters are optional.

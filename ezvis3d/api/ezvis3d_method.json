Parameter pos is an object which contains three parameters: horizontal, vertical, and distance. Parameter horizontal is a value in radians and can have any value (but normally in the range of 0 and 2*Pi). Parameter vertical is a value in radians between 0 and 0.5*Pi. Parameter distance is the (normalized) distance from the camera to the center of the graph, in the range of 0.71 to 5.0. A larger distance puts the graph further away, making it smaller. All parameters are optional."}]

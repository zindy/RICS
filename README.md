RICS notes

RICS calculations on confocal image stacks of beads (2D + t). Check the notebook on nbviewer, over at: 
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/zindy/RICS/blob/master/RICS_calculation.ipynb

The following test images (100nm beads) are provided for testing (the original LIF files were converted to TIFF in FIJI / ImageJ):

* **050917 40 nm 4.8us 100nm beads 20 scan v 2.tif :** https://mega.nz/#!IxFxXSZb!g8oJ9J3TCfKjy8Qj91_Wp_A7G2KVRF0CrxBk7FiUd1k
* **050917 40 nm 4.8us 100nm beads 20 scan v3.tif :** https://mega.nz/#!E59WSRZZ!8wKBpNBpfABLk497enTJ7YCOdYX1gbswSWSCcFxeZfE

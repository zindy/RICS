# RICS
RICS notes

RICS calculations on confocal image stacks of beads (2D + t).

Check the notebook on nbviewer, over at: 
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/zindy/RICS/blob/master/RICS_calculation.ipynb

or have a play with the code over on Binder at:
https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/zindy/RICS/master?filepath=RICS_calculation.ipynb

The following test images (100nm beads) are provided for testing (the original LIF files were converted to TIFF in FIJI / ImageJ):

* **050917 40nm 4.8us 100nm beads 20 scan v2.tif :** https://github.com/zindy/RICS/raw/master/050917%2040nm%204.8us%20100nm%20beads%2020%20scan%20v2.tif
* **050917 40nm 4.8us 100nm beads 20 scan v3.tif :** https://github.com/zindy/RICS/raw/master/050917%2040nm%204.8us%20100nm%20beads%2020%20scan%20v3.tif
